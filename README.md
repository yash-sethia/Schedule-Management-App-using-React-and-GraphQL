<h1>Schedule Management App</h1>
  
  A simple Schedule management app where a user can look att all the things he is suuposed to do today and in the next 4 days.
  
  The frontend of the app has been created using React while the server side is working on GraphQL.
  
  I have used Hasura GraphQL API to implement the server side and use a PostgresSQL Server which is available by default on Hasura.
  
  The frontend uses React libraries like Material UI and Ract Bootstrap to make this website responsive.
